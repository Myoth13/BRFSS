This is my "Hello world" project which I'm currently making for the course "Introduction to Probability and Data with R".
Aim of this project is to explore risk factors for type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance.
In my future project I want to evaluate each risk factor using proper statistical technique.

It is my first research project and I would be happy to hear any comments and suggestions
